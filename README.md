# Quora-question-pair-similarity
Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. 

Currently, Quora uses a Random Forest model to identify duplicate questions.This kaggle competerion is to tackle this natural language processing problem by applying advanced techniques to classify whether question pairs are duplicates or not. Doing so will make it easier to find high quality answers to questions resulting in an improved experience for Quora writers, seekers, and readers.

The dataset just contained 5 features: Question1 ID, Question2 ID, Question1, Question2, Flag which records whether the question is duplicate or not.

This repository contains two folders. In one folder I have shown exploratory data analysis, and how I have extreacted both NLP and non NLP features from this dataset.
The second folder is models I built to predict if two questions are duplicate or not.
